# ECN-Asset-Map
This was an asset map that a group of employees ages 14 - 19 created. I was only the facilitator and thus did none of the actual coding.  They learned how to use javascript, html elements, and google maps api to create this webpage. 

In order to get this up and running you need a minimalistic back-end to host the files. In class and for our demonstration we used python's SimpleHTTPServer module, which works well in theory, but in production youm might need something more powerfull than that. This Website was created with the intent of being a part of ECN's website but it can also function as a stand alone website. 

Credit goes to the ECN Coders team.
